# [Cloudflared-web](https://github.com/WisdomSky/Cloudflared-web)

_Cloudflared-web is a docker image that packages both [cloudflared cli](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) and a simple Web UI to easily start or stop remotely-managed Cloudflare tunnel._

## Why use `Cloudflared-web`?

#### Pros

✅ Only need to run a docker command once. No need to run docker commands everytime you want to start or stop the container or when updating the token.

✅ Start and stop cloudflare tunnel anytime with a single click.

#### Cons

❌ Only supports [Remotely-managed Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/remote-management/).

❌ Can only update hostname policies through the [ZeroTrust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) dashboard.

## Application Setup
When manually setting up this image, it is crucial to always set the `networking mode` into `host` as without it, the cloudflared service won't be able to access the services running on the host:

    docker run --network host wisdomsky/cloudflared-web:latest

or if using `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  cloudflared:
    image: wisdomsky/cloudflared-web:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

The Web UI where you can setup the Cloudflared token can be accessed from port `14333`:

    http://localhost:14333

### Github Containers

If for some reason you are unable to pull images from Docker's Official Image Registry (docker.io), `Cloudflared-web` is also synced to Github Container Registry (ghcr.io).

Just prefix the image with `ghcr.io/` in order to use the mirrored image in Github.
```yaml
services:
  cloudflared:
    image: ghcr.io/wisdomsky/cloudflared-web:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
```

## Additional Parameters

### Environment
| Variable Name     | Default value | Required or Optional | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| WEBUI_PORT        | 14333         | _Optional_ | The port on the host where the WebUI will be running. Useful when an existing process is running on port `14333` and want to assign cloudflared-web into a different available port.                                                                                                                                                |
| BASIC_AUTH_PASS   |               | _Optional_ | Enable Basic Auth by specifying a password. If `BASIC_AUTH_USER` is not specified, the default value for username `admin` will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| BASIC_AUTH_USER   | admin         | _Optional_ | Specify the username for the Basic Auth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| EDGE_BIND_ADDRESS |               | _Optional_ | Specifies the outgoing IP address used to establish a connection between `cloudflared` and the Cloudflare global network.<br/><br/>The IP version of `EDGE_BIND_ADDRESS` will override `EDGE_IP_VERSION` (if provided). For example, if you enter an IPv6 source address, `cloudflared` will always connect to an IPv6 destination. |
| EDGE_IP_VERSION   | auto          | _Optional_ | Specifies the IP address version (IPv4 or IPv6) used to establish a connection between `cloudflared` and the Cloudflare global network. Available values are `auto`, `4`, and `6`.                                                                                                                                                  |
| PROTOCOL          | auto          | _Optional_ | Specifies the protocol used to establish a connection between `cloudflared` and the Cloudflare global network. Available values are `auto`, `http2`, and `quic`.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| GRACE_PERIOD      | 30s           | _Optional_ | When `cloudflared` receives SIGINT/SIGTERM it will stop accepting new requests, wait for in-progress requests to terminate, then shut down. Waiting for in-progress requests will timeout after this grace period, or when a second SIGTERM/SIGINT is received.                                                                     |
| REGION            |               | _Optional_ | Allows you to choose the regions to which connections are established. Currently the only available value is `us`, which routes all connections through data centers in the United States. Omit or leave empty to connect to the global region.                                                                                     |
| RETRIES           | 5             | _Optional_ | Specifies the maximum number of retries for connection/protocol errors. Retries use exponential backoff (retrying at `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, `16` seconds by default), so it is **NOT RECOMMENDED** that you increase this value significantly.                                                                                         |
| METRICS_ENABLE    | false         | _Optional_ | Enable [tunnel metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/monitor-tunnels/metrics/) server.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| METRICS_PORT      | 60123         | _Optional_ | Specify port to run tunnel metrics on. `METRICS_ENABLE` must be set to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Based on Cloudflare [tunel run parameters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-run-parameters/) documentation.


example `docker-compose.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  cloudflared:
    image: wisdomsky/cloudflared-web:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      WEBUI_PORT: 1111
      PROTOCOL: http2
```


### Volume
| Container Path | Required or Optional | Description |
|---|---|---|
| /config | _Optional_ | The path to the directory where the `config.json` file containing the Cloudflare token and start status will be saved.  |

example `docker-compose.yaml`:
```yaml
services:
  cloudflared:
    image: wisdomsky/cloudflared-web:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /mnt/storage/cloudflared/config:/config
```

## Using Networks

You can use docker `networks` for a more fine-grained control of which containers/services your cloudflared-web container has access to.

```yaml
services:
  cloudflared:
    image: wisdomsky/cloudflared-web:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - mynetwork
    environment:
      WEBUI_PORT: 1111
```
